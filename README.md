# Captcha-Recognition

Captcha recognition is a process designed to automate the interpretation and extraction of meaningful information from captcha images, commonly employed on websites to distinguish human users from automated scripts. The initial step involves loading the captcha image using image processing libraries like Pillow, followed by preprocessing techniques such as resizing and contrast adjustment to enhance features relevant to recognition. Integration with automation workflows, especially in web scraping scenarios, completes the process. Despite its utility, captcha recognition faces challenges posed by the deliberate distortion and obfuscation of characters in captchas. Advanced captchas may necessitate more sophisticated techniques, including neural networks or deep learning models. Additionally, security considerations underline the need for ongoing adaptation as websites evolve their captcha mechanisms to thwart automated recognition and maintain a secure online environment.
